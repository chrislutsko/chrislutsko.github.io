For prospective PhD students, please remember two things when applying to work with me: 

- In the US system graduate students enter without an advisor, this gives students time to find a suitable advisor. Please only apply to work with me if you are at least in your second year at UH.
- Please do not send me a generic email. Show that you at least visited my website and wrote a new email.
