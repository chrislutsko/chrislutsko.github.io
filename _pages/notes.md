This page is a place to put various notes and surveys which I occasionally write. Some are written for specific purposes and some are written for fun, very little here is new. I'm sure all of them contain typos or even errors. Please feel free to email me if you spot one or have questions. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2\.  <b>Primes as sums of squares</b> A note proving that any prime congruent to $1$ mod $4$ can be written as the sum of two primes, using an algorithm which generates the primes [[pdf](../files/Primes_Sums_of_Squares.pdf)] [[mathematica](sum_of_squares.nb)].

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\.  <b>Abracadabra</b> A note on one of my favorite proofs from the theory of Martingales on the time it would take for a monkey to type the word ABRACADABRA. [[pdf](../files/Abracadabra.pdf)].
