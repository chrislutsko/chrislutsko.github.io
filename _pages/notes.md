This page is a place to put various notes and surveys which I occasionally write. Some are written for specific purposes and some are written for fun, very little here is new. I'm sure all of them contain typos or even errors. Please feel free to email me if you spot one or have questions. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1\.  <b>Abracadabra</b> A note on one of my favorite proofs from the theory of Martingales on the time it would take for a monkey to type the word ABRACADABRA. [[pdf](../files/Abracadabra.pdf)].
