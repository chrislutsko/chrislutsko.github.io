In Fall 2024 I will start an assistant professor position at the University of Houson. 

In September 2023 I began a post-doc at the University of Zurich, where my mentor is [Alex Gorodnik](https://www.math.uzh.ch/gorodnik/).

From 2020 to 2023 I was a Hill assistant professor (post-doc) at Rutgers university, my mentor was [Alex Kontorovich](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~alexk/).  Before this I received my PhD at the University of Bristol under the supervision of [Jens Marklof](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/home.html) and [Bálint Tóth](https://sites.google.com/view/balint-toth-math/home). 



My research interests lie at the intersection of several topics including number theory, spectral theory, homogeneous dynamics, and mathematical physics. For a non-technical introduction to one aspect of my work, see [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-numbers-look-random-but-arent-mathematicians-prove/) in Scientific American which I wrote.
