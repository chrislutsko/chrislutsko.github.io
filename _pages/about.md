As of September 2020, I am a Hill Assistant Prof. (post-doc) at Rutgers university, with research interests in a broad range of topics relating to number theory, dynamical systems, and mathematical physics. Before this I received my PhD at the University of Bristol under the supervision of [Jens Marklof](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/home.html) and [Balint Toth](https://sites.google.com/view/balint-toth-math/home). 

In the Fall of 2021 I will be organizing the Rutgers number theory seminar. Feel free to get in contact about possible talks.

***Pseudo-Random Properties of Deterministic Sequences***

In the 20th century, starting with the work of Weyl, mathematicians became interested in the statistical properties of monomial sequences of the form $(\alpha n^\theta \mod 1 )_{n>0}$ where $\alpha >0$ and $\theta >0$. From a number theoretic point of view there is a natural question one can ask: in the limit as we consider more and more sequence elements, what can be said about the asymptotic distribution of these points? In other words, can we see random behavior emerging from these sequences?

While this question has a natural motivation from a number theory perspective, there is also a deep connection to quantum chaos. Namely, the Berry-Tabor conjecture (See [these notes](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/bib/3ecm.pdf) by [J. Marklof](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/home.html)) hypothesizes a connection between the the chaotic properties of a given system with the pseudo-random properties of the eigenvalues of corresponding quantom analog. These monomial sequences can appear as the eigenvalues of a quantum system, and thus determining the pseudo-random properties can shed light on this deep hypothesized connection in quantum chaos. 

One very strong measure of pseudo-randomness, is the so-called 'pair correlation function'. In [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09800), together with [A. Sourmelidis](https://www.math.tugraz.at/~sourmelidis/) and [N. Technau](https://sites.google.com/view/niclas-technaus-website), we showed that a wide class of these monomial sequences exhibit Poissonian pair correlation. In fact, this is one the only examples where the pair correlation function has been shown to converge to the Poissonian limit for explicit values of $\alpha$ and $\theta$. The paper builds on a methodology outlined in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09292) which proved convergence of (so-called) 'long-range correlations' (a weaker measure of pseudo-randomness) for some other monomial sequences.
