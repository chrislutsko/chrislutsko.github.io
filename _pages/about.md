In September 2023 I will begin a new post-doc at the University of Zurich, where my mentor will be [Alex Gorodnik](https://www.math.uzh.ch/gorodnik/).

Since September 2020 I have been a Hill assistant professor (post-doc) at Rutgers university, my mentor is [Alex Kontorovich](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~alexk/). My research interests lie at the intersection of several topics including number theory, spectral theory, homogeneous dynamics, and mathematical physics. Before this I received my PhD at the University of Bristol under the supervision of [Jens Marklof](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/home.html) and [Bálint Tóth](https://sites.google.com/view/balint-toth-math/home).
