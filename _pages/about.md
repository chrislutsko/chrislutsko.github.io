As of September 2020, I am a Hill Assistant Prof. (post-doc) at Rutgers university, with research interests in a broad range of topics relating to number theory, dynamical systems, and mathematical physics. Before this I received my PhD at the University of Bristol under the supervision of [Jens Marklof](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/home.html) and [Balint Toth](https://sites.google.com/view/balint-toth-math/home). 

In the Fall of 2021 I will be organizing the Rutgers number theory seminar. Feel free to get in contact about possible talks.

**Research Interests**
=====
***Random Properties of Deterministic Sequences***

In the 20th century, starting with the work of Weyl, mathematicians became interested in the statistical properties of monomial sequences of the form $(\alpha n^\theta \mod 1 )_{n>0}$ where $\alpha >0$ and $\theta >0$. From a number theoretic point of view there is a natural question one can ask: in the limit as we consider more and more sequence elements, what can be said about the asymptotic distribution of these points? In other words, can we see random behavior emerging from these sequences?

***Asymptotic Distribution of Thin Groups***

***Lorentz Gas and Non-Interacting Particle Systems***
