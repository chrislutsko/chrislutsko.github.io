As of Fall 2024 I am an assistant professor at the University of Houston. 

From 2023-24 I was a post-doc at the University of Zurich, where my mentor was [Alex Gorodnik](https://www.math.uzh.ch/gorodnik/). From 2020 to 2023 I was a Hill assistant professor at Rutgers university, my mentor was [Alex Kontorovich](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~alexk/).  Before that I received my PhD at the University of Bristol under the supervision of [Jens Marklof](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~majm/home.html) and [Bálint Tóth](https://sites.google.com/view/balint-toth-math/home)



My research interests lie at the intersection of several topics including number theory, spectral theory, homogeneous dynamics, and mathematical physics. For a non-technical introduction to one aspect of my work, see [this article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/these-numbers-look-random-but-arent-mathematicians-prove/) in Scientific American which I wrote (Es gibt auch eine Übersetzung unter [Spektrum der Wissenschaft](https://www.spektrum.de/news/zwei-mathematiker-erzeugen-die-zufaelligsten-folgen-der-welt/2205985)).
